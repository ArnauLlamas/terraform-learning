# Terraform Learning
Repository aimed to help newcomers to Terraform start with it in a simple and path oriented way using the AWS cloud in the examples.


### Additional tools
Along with Terraform, this repository assumes that you have all extra tools to ensure Terraforms workflow, these are:
* A Terminal emulator
* AWS CLI or a way to set up AWS credentials into your environment
  * If you are using Zsh and/or [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) we strongly recommend its [AWS plugin](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/aws)
* A version manager to easily exchange Terraform versions
  * This repo includes [ASDF](https://asdf-vm.com/) Tool Versions files, but [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv) should also do the trick
